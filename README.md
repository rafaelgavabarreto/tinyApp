# tinyApp

Project Description
Goal

This four-day project will have you building a web app using Node. The app will allow users to shorten long URLs much like TinyURL.com and bit.ly do.

You will build an HTTP Server that handles requests from the browser (client). Along the way you'll get introduced to some more advanced JavaScript and Node concepts, and you'll also learn more about Express, a web framework which is very popular in the Node community.

Functional Requirements
User Stories
As an avid twitter poster,
I want to be able to shorten links
so that I can fit more non-link text in my tweets.

As a twitter reader,
I want to be able to visit sites via shortened links,
so that I can read interesting content.

(Stretch) As an avid twitter poster,
I want to be able to see how many times my subscribers visit my links
so that I can learn what content they like.
